<h3> Hi, I'm Morgan!</h3>  
      
 <p> This is a digital character and background design for animtion portfolio. Throughout this portfolio you'' see various designs from both personal and school projects that outline my techinal skills.</p>
<br> <p>The purpose of this website is to act as an art portfolio for future work and to hopefully one day land me a job when the website is complete. And while I do want this to look well put together and be easy to navigate I also want to learn how to incorporate some fun stylization to the pages in order to help it stand out against competitors. Overall I want the pages to be very interactive and colorful that not only stands well enough on its own, but also highlight the pieces/ projects that will be showcased here.</p>
